## Tip calculator
- What progress have you made for your project so far?
  I've made it through out most of the project, but I will be finishing some of the JavaScript.
- Are there any challenges you have / have faced? How will you / did you overcome them?
  I think that the most challenging thing is obviously Javascript, since I haven't done anything with calculations yet, but I hope I can fix that.
- Are there any other questions you have for your instructors?
  No questions for right now, but if I give a question, it would have to be for JavaScript.
- Are there any concepts you are not so familiar with?
  I'm familiar with most of the concepts, just trying to get around the understanding in JavaScript.
